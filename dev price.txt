You have three core moments: ideation (Optimize/Idea/Brainstorm), generation (models Flash/Medium/Large/Turbo), and post-gen editing (upscale, inpaint/outpaint, background, etc.).
The most important UX principle is momentum: reduce context switching between “I like this direction” and “let me tweak it.” That informs whether editing should be inline or on a separate page, and how model selection appears.
Editing tools placement: inline first, dedicated editor second

Why inline: Users are most motivated right after a result appears. A “Post-Generate Editor” panel inside the result view lets them upscale, erase/inpaint, outpaint, relight, or generate 3 quick variations without leaving the page.
Dedicated editor: Keep a full “Editor” workspace accessible from Dashboard > My Designs for deep edits later (batch upscales, background removal, large canvases, precise inpainting). This is ideal for saved designs.
Minimal viable structure
Result screen: show the final grid/image plus an “Edit” side panel (collapsible). Tabs: Adjust (Upscale, Relight), Retouch (Erase/Inpaint/Outpaint), Background (Remove/Replace), Variations (x3 reseeds).
Each tool shows its INK cost on the button before use. If balance is insufficient, open a slim top-up modal with “Subscribe” vs “Top up INK.”
“Open in Editor” button deep-links the current image into the dedicated Editor page if the user wants full-screen tools.
Why not separate-only: Forcing a page change after Generate breaks momentum and reduces conversions. Inline first; dedicated second covers both behaviors.
Model selection: simple default with optional control

Default: “Auto (Recommended)” decides the model based on tier and context:
Free → Flash
Creator → Medium for first pass, Large when “More detail” toggle is on, Flash for fast previews
Studio → Large by default, Turbo when “Max detail” toggle is on
Advanced toggle: Show a compact picker so power users can choose explicitly with microcopy and visible INK cost. This keeps transparency and control without overwhelming new users.
UI approach (works on desktop and mobile)
Quality slider (Draft / Standard / Detailed / Pro+), with a “Show models” link.
Or simple radio: Auto (Recommended), Flash, Medium, Large, Turbo. Locked items show a lock icon with “Upgrade to unlock.” The Generate button always updates to show the exact INK cost for the current choice.
Micro-economics and clarity

Always show balance as “Balance: 246 INK — ≈ 30 Flash or 8 Turbo left.”
All action buttons show INK costs upfront.
Regenerate bundle buttons show savings: “3x reseed — 16 INK (save 33%).”
Editing tool costs appear inline on the tool controls; confirm before deducting.
Keep Free tier editing available but meaningful: allow preview edits or 1–2 upscales so they feel the power, then require INK or upgrade.
UI update checklist for your developer (direct, build-ready)

Global
Header: show INK balance pill “246 INK” with tooltip “≈ 30 Flash or 8 Turbo.”
Low-balance modal: offers
Subscribe (shows Creator/Studio with included INK and per-INK effective note)
Session Booster: 120 INK for $5.99
Token Packs: 80/$4.99, 200/$9, 600/$24, 1500/$49
INK refund toast: “Refunded 12 INK due to an error.”
2. Model picker (on session workspace, above Generate)

Default: Auto (Recommended). Subtext: “Picks the best model for your tier and detail.”
“Manual” toggle reveals:
Flash — Fast draft — 8 INK — best for quick concepts
Medium — Balanced — 12 INK — best for clean previews
Large — Detailed — 18 INK — best for final concepts
Turbo — Max detail — 30 INK — best for premium finals
Lock states by tier:
Free: only Flash; others show lock with “Upgrade to Creator to unlock Medium/Large; Studio for Turbo.”
Generate button text updates in real time: “Generate — 12 INK (6–12s)”
3. Ask TaTTTy controls (near text input)

Optimize button: shows cost by tier (Free: 3 INK; Creator/Studio: Free).
Idea button: cost by tier (Free: 5 INK; Creator: 1 INK; Studio: Free up to 50/day).
Brainstorm chat chip: “10 messages — [8 INK Free] [2 INK Creator] [Free Studio up to 200/day].” Show a small usage counter.
4. Post-Generate Result screen

Left: result grid or single image with tabs for Variations (x3 reseed), Download, Share.
Right: Edit panel (collapsible). Tabs:
Adjust: Upscale (2x/4x), Relight
Retouch: Erase/Inpaint/Outpaint
Background: Remove/Replace
Controls used: shows any ControlNet applied (Sketch/Structure/Style/Style Transfer)
Each tool has:
Microcopy: “2x Upscale — 4 INK (Fast). Estimated 2–5s.”
Confirm button. Deduct INK after success; auto-refund if fail.
5. Dedicated Editor page (from Dashboard > My Designs and from “Open in Editor”)

Same tool set as the Edit panel but full-screen canvas.
Breadcrumb and “Back to results” link.
INK costs identical to inline panel.
6. Pricing page (3 tiers)

Free, Creator ($12/mo), Studio ($29/mo). Annual toggle (2 months free).
Show included monthly INK, models unlocked, Ask TaTTTy costs, rollover, and queue priority.
Token packs below with clear per-INK cost that’s worse than subscription (by design).
7. Rollover and streak

Rollover info: “Unused INK rolls for 60 days (paid) / 30 days (free).”
Streak widget: “+5 INK/day logged in; cap +25/week.”
8. Paywalls and nudges

When user clicks a locked model or tool, show a slim inline banner: “Unlock Large model with Creator. $12/mo — includes 400 INK/month.”
When INK insufficient: offer Session Booster or packs; secondary action “Subscribe” with “cheaper INK” rationale (no salesy language).
9. Events to instrument (for tuning)

model_selected, generate_clicked, generate_succeeded/failed, edit_tool_used (tool, model, INK), optimize_clicked, idea_clicked, brainstorm_opened/messages, pack_purchased, subscribe_started/completed, low_balance_modal_shown, reseed_bundle_used.
10. Copy blocks you can paste

Auto model tooltip: “Auto chooses the best model for your tier so you get speed when exploring and detail when finalizing.”
INK tooltip: “INK is your creative fuel. Every action shows its INK cost before you confirm. Unused INK rolls over for 60 days on paid plans.”
Regenerate bundle: “Try 3 new seeds — get one free.”
How to present the four models to users

Keep Auto as the default.
Provide manual picker for transparency and control (plus visible INK cost).
Lock unavailable models by tier with a subtle lock icon and one-line rationale.
Do not hide models entirely; seeing locked options sets a clear value ladder without being pushy.
Rationale for this setup

Inline editor keeps the excitement loop tight, boosting conversions and perceived value.
Dedicated editor supports deeper work on saved designs without rushing.
Auto defaults reduce choice paralysis; manual picker preserves power.
Visible INK costs build trust; bundles and reseed discounts encourage “one more try” responsibly.
